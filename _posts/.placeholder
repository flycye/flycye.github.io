# Beginner Concepts 🤍

🎉 **Goal**: Learn what binaries are, how to break them, and their protections.

By finding vulnerabilities in binaries, we can gain access or control of various places in a program to conduct privilege scalation or code execution.

## What’s a Binary?

- **Definition**: ****A binary is compiled code.
- **Types of Binaries**
    - **Executable and Linking Format (ELF):** Used on Linux and UNIX systems
    - **Portable Executable Format (PE):** Used on Windows
- **Inside a Binary:** Below I will describe some sections which organize the binary’s data and code.

- `.text`: Holds the program’s instructions (Should be read only. Writing here will definitely cause a segfault-!)
- `.data`: Contains global and static variables that are explicitly initialized by the program
- `.bss`: Uninitialized data (filled with zeros by default)
- **Heap**: Dynamic memory that grows from the end of the `.bss` section to higher memory addresses
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure that stores the return address, parameters, and local variables.

## Common Vulnerabilities

- **Buffer Overflows:** Occur when a program writes more data into a buffer than it can hold.
- **Vulnerable Functions:** These are examples of some C functions which don’t check input size.
    - `gets`: reads user input without any limit
    - `strcpy`: copies strings without checking bounds
    - `sprintf`: formats strings without size limits
    - `scanf`: can be misused to overflow buffers
    - `strcat`: appends strings without checking available space
- **Format String Vulnerabilities:** Misusing `printf` with the **string format specifier** `%s`,  allowing an attacker to leak addresses in memory (Peek the [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/software-exploitation/format-string-exploits/) dojo if you want to practice some challenges 👀).

## Binary Protections

Binary protections, or mitigations, are mechanisms used to protect binaries against arbitrary code execution and other attacks. In the picture below we see the output of the command `checksec`. To use this outside of `gdb-peda` (see important links below), you can enter `checksec --file=<binary_name>`.

The output of `checksec` gives us a starting point for exploiting our binary.

**Stack Canary**: a random value put on the stack before the saved return address, if this is overwritten the program will exit (crash)
**NX (no eXecute)**: prevents parts of the program that aren't code to be executed (ex. stack, heap)
**ASLR (address space layout randomization)**: randomizes memory addresses to make it difficult to predict executable places in code
**PIE (position independent executable)**: enables ASLR for the binary
**RELRO (relocation read-only)**: protects the global offset table (GOT), full RELRO is the most secure

However, even with these mitigations in place, binaries can be exploited!

Once you understand basic **stack buffer** overflows, there are many more advanced techniques to bypass protections.

## Stack Buffer Overflows

This basic type of overflow occurs when a program writes more bytes into a buffer than it can hold! Doing so corrupts the rest of the stack, overflowing the extra bytes into other registers, such as `rip` (pointer to the next instruction).

ex.

```c

void win() {
    printf("yuppee!");
    system("/bin/sh");
}

void vuln() {
    char buffer[16];
    printf("enter: ");
    gets(buffer);
    printf("you entered: %s\\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    vuln();
    return 0;
}
```

With an example like this, if we enter more than 16 bytes when prompted, we will overwrite saved registers and eventually the return address. This is because `gets(buffer)` is reading the user input without actually checking the length. Knowing this, we can now learn more in-depth exploitation techniques.

# Intermediate Concepts 🤍

🎉 **Goal**: Learn more techniques for exploiting binaries, learn how to use a disassembler to analyze code, and get familiar with using `gdb` to pinpoint addresses to create good exploits.

I will only go over a few basic techniques. Refer to the binary exploitation guide [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/) to view more CTF-related examples, and the [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/binary-exploitation/) binary exploitation course to learn more about memory errors and shellcode injections.

## Return Oriented Programming (ROP)

When binary protections such as **NX** are enabled, we cannot arbitrarily execute shellcode on the stack. Still, this doesn’t stop us from creating exploits. ROP involves chaining together **gadgets**, which are parts of existing code, to redirect program execution.

<aside>

Refer to [Red Team Notes - ROP Chaining](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/binary-exploitation/rop-chaining-return-oriented-programming) for some practical examples and diagrams.

## Ret2Win (return-to-win)

Looking at our **Stack Buffer Overflow** example from before, we see a function `win()`. Because we could easily find out the address of the win function, we can calculate the offset needed to overwrite the return address (use `gdb-peda` **+ pattern generation**, and overwrite the return address with the address of `win()`.

## Ret2Lib (return-to-library)

We use return-oriented programming (ROP) to call functions from a loaded library like `libc`.

This technique is primarily used when NX is enabled, meaning that **injecting shellcode in the program** is not allowed. However, we can use existing like `system()` to pop a shell (ex. `system("/bin/sh")`).

## Stack Pivoting

We redirect execution by manipulating `ebp` ****(base pointer) to control the stack. To do this, we will use the **gadget** `leave; ret`

ex. leave gadget

```
pop ebp
ret    ; return to address on stack=
```

## Off-By-One Exploits

An exploit where we alter the least significant byte (**LSB)** of `ebp` — used in scenarios where we cannot completely overwrite the register but can only increment/decrement to direct program execution.

ex.

```
ebp = 0x41424344
ebp = 0x41424300
```

# Advanced Concepts 🤍

🎉 **Goal**: Learn basics about heap exploitation and another advanced exploitation method — SROP — when traditional exploitation methods don’t suffice.

## Heap Exploitation

Similar to stack buffer overflow, heap overflows occur when more data is read into a buffer than what it can hold

**Use After Free**: use of a `free`'d object in program

I took an example code snippet from the [CTF101 Guide](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/heap-exploitation/):

```jsx
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct string {
    unsigned length;
    char *data;
} string;

int main() {
    struct string* s = malloc(sizeof(string));
    puts("Length:");
    scanf("%u", &s->length);
    s->data = malloc(s->length + 1);
    memset(s->data, 0, s->length + 1);
    puts("Data:");
    read(0, s->data, s->length);

    free(s->data);
    free(s);

    char *s2 = malloc(16);
    memset(s2, 0, 16);
    puts("More data:");
    read(0, s2, 15);

    // Now using s again, a UAF

    puts(s->data);

    return 0;
}
```

## Sigreturn Oriented Programming

When traditional ROP just doesn't cut it, we can still bypass NX by using signal handler mechanisms. Additionally, SROP can be useful when a program is **not linked to libc** (we don’t have `system()` that we can just jump to).

### **SROP vs. ROP**

SROP exploits are similar to ROP in that **they both use gadgets**, however, having **ASLR** enabled limits the use of ROP chaining as finding gadgets is extremely difficult without a given leaked address (by a format string exploitation, for example). Additionally, **SROP requires a minimal amount of gadgets that are always present in memory (see** [the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigreturn-oriented_programming)).

### Signals in POSIX-like Systems

Here’s a snippet from [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/16-srop/backdoor_funsignals/index.html) explaining how the signal handler mechanism works:

> “When the kernel delivers a signal from a program, it creates a frame on the stack before it is passed to the signal handler. Then after that is done that frame is used as context for a sigreturn syscall to return code execution to where it was interrupted. It does this by popping values off of the top of the stack into registers, which were stored there so execution could continue after the signal is dealt with. The syscall itself takes a single argument in the `rdi` register (however for our use, it's not important in this context). We can tell that a sigreturn syscall is being made since it pops the value **0xf** into the `ra` register before making the syscall to specify a sigreturn syscall.”

</aside>

Using the `sigreturn()` system call, we can set up and take control of registers such as `eip` (the instruction pointer) with just one single gadget. Sometimes, this gadget can have a fixed address within the program. With control over the registers, we can alter them to call whichever syscall we would like (ex. `write` to print the contents of a flag).

We can use `pwntool`'s method of `SigreturnFrame()` to automate building a sigreturn frame, all we have to do is prepare the registers for the syscall.
