# Hi, I'm Nefeli! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my blog :)

I love making guides about the things I'm learning about, both so I can track my progress and to help other beginners grasp some difficult concepts more easily.

## What you'll find me writing

I try and create easy-to-read guides for various CTF topics, and am planning to expand from binary exploitation to web exploitation and forensics.

I've even built challenges in real competitions (like UIC's cyber team), and am excited to collaborate more with the security community and any newcomer who wants to learn about cyber.

## Made With

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)

Please contact me if you want me to make a guide for a specific topic, either through opening an issue or through my discord @ `n.efeli`.
