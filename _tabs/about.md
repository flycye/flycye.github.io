Hi, I'm Nefeli :)
I'm a Senior studying Computer Science with a focus on low-level systems and vulnerability research. 
I'm currently exploring kernel exploitation, preparing for CTF competitions like Sekai, and making my own CTF Guides.

# Experience

Ever since I discovered the world of CTFs in November of 2024, I've tried to get more involved in the security community.

I've:
- Led my own CTF team, participating with them in NCL (Fall 2024, **46th** nationally, Advanced Student Bracket)
- Been a Scribe for my university's cybersecurity club (Layer Zero)
- Created CTF guides both for my team as well as for personal learning
